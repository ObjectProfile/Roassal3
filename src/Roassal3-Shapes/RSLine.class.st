RSLine describes a line. This example shows how to create a line with basic properties

```
line := RSLine new.
line startPoint: 40@30.
line endPoint: 220@140.
line color: Color blue.
line width: 10.
line dashArray: #(8 4).
```
A line typically links two shapes. Here is an example:

```
| c from to l |
c := RSCanvas new.

from := RSBox new size: 30.
to := RSEllipse new size: 30.

from @ RSDraggable.
to @ RSDraggable.

c add: from.
c add: to.

l := RSLine new.
l attachPoint: RSCenteredAttachPoint new.
l from: from.
l to: to.
c add: l.

to translateBy: 50 @ 40.

c @ RSCanvasController.
c
```

Adding single line can be complex in some situation. You may want to look at `RSLineBuilder` to ease the line creation.
