"
The PLTSpineDecoration class represent the spine of a matplot visualization. It represents the surrounding box that contains plots and scatters.

The class has the responsibilty to draw a usually black box around a visualization. 

The class collaborates with PLT and PLTTitleDecoration. The PLTTitleDecoration class requires the shape in order to put a title above.

The method is not meant to be used by a normal user as it represents a functionality to be used directly by PLT, and does not offer much configuration.
